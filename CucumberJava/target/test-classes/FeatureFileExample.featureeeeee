Feature: Feature to login functionality

  # A Feature can have a multiple scenario
  Scenario: Check login is successful with valid credentials
    # Now, we have to create the steps with 'Gherkin Language'. For this, we have keywords -> Given, When, And, Then
    Given user is on login page
    When user clicks enters username and password
    And clicks on login button
    Then user is navigated to the home page

  Scenario Outline: Check login is successful with valid credentials
    # If we are doing Parameterization and using 'Examples', then in that case we use "Scenario Outline"
    Given user is on login page
    When user clicks enters <username> and <password>
    And clicks on login button
    Then user is navigated to the home page

# Scenario will run 2 Times with multiple set of data
    Examples: 
      | username | password |
      | user1    | pass1    |
      | user2    | pass2    |
